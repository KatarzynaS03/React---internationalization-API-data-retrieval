# React---internationalization-API-data-retrieval
The application was created as part of completing the list 8 from the subject of Network Technologies - biomedical engineering, year III.

The goal was to create a simple React application that would retrieve data from ESO^1's National Grid API - the official carbon dioxide intensity API in the UK. Using Formik, a form was created to enter the date (separate day, month, year, e.g. 1-1-2020). After the correct data input into the form, the data will be downloaded from the API. After correctly loading the data, the line graphs of the hourly actual and forecast values in CanvasJS will be created. I18n was used to internationalize the application in Polish, English and German.
